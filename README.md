# Video Game Success Prediction

This project analyzes video game sales and reviews to identify the factors that make a game successful.  
We use open datasets that include information about platforms, genres, ESRB ratings, critic/user scores, and regional sales.

## Project Goals
- Explore historical video game sales data across platforms and regions.  
- Identify key patterns that influence commercial success.  
- Build a foundation for predictive modeling of future game performance.  
- Provide insights that can guide marketing and advertising strategies.

## Data
The dataset includes:
- **Game details**: Name, Platform, Year of Release, Genre, Publisher.  
- **Sales data**: Regional and global sales figures.  
- **Reviews**: Critic and user scores.  
- **Metadata**: ESRB ratings and release info.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploration and analysis.  

## Next Steps
- Data cleaning (duplicates, missing values).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Feature engineering (ratings, platforms, sales aggregation).  
- Modeling and evaluation.
